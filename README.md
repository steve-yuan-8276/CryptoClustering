# CryptoClustering

This project uses Python and unsupervised learning techniques to analyze the effect of 24-hour and 7-day price changes on cryptocurrencies. By employing K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we explore potential groupings of cryptocurrencies and assess the impact of feature reduction on clustering accuracy.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to determine if cryptocurrencies can be grouped based on their 24-hour and 7-day price change behavior using unsupervised machine learning methods. The project involves:

- **Data Normalization** using `StandardScaler()`
- **Clustering** using K-means algorithm
- **Dimensionality Reduction** using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- **Visualization and Comparison** of clusters before and after applying PCA

## Steps and Instructions

### 1. Data Loading and Preparation

- **Load the Data**: The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame from the file `crypto_market_data.csv`.
- **Summary Statistics**: Initial exploration of the dataset is performed by generating summary statistics.
- **Data Normalization**: The data is scaled using `StandardScaler()` to ensure all features have equal weight in the clustering process.

### 2. Finding the Best Value for _k_ Using the Elbow Method

- **Elbow Method**: We use the elbow method to determine the best number of clusters (_k_) by plotting the inertia values for _k_ ranging from 1 to 11.
- **Optimal _k_ Value**: The plot is used to identify the optimal number of clusters, which was found to be **4**.

### 3. K-means Clustering on the Scaled Data

- **Cluster Cryptocurrencies**: Using the K-means algorithm with _k_=4, the cryptocurrencies are clustered based on their 24-hour and 7-day price change data.
- **Visualization**: The clusters are visualized using `hvPlot`, where:
    - **X-axis**: `"price_change_percentage_24h"`
    - **Y-axis**: `"price_change_percentage_7d"`
    - Each point is color-coded based on its cluster and labeled with the corresponding `coin_id` for easy identification.

### 4. Dimensionality Reduction with PCA

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: The features are reduced to 3 principal components using PCA to simplify the data while retaining as much variance as possible.
- **Explained Variance**: We calculated the explained variance to determine how much information is preserved after reducing the dimensionality. The first three principal components explained approximately **89%** of the variance.
- **New DataFrame**: A new DataFrame is created based on the 3 principal components, indexed by `coin_id`.

### 5. Finding the Best Value for _k_ Using PCA

- **Elbow Method (PCA)**: The elbow method is applied again using the reduced data to identify the optimal _k_ value for the PCA-transformed data. The optimal number of clusters remained **4**.
- **Comparison**: We compared the optimal _k_ value obtained from the original scaled data and the PCA-reduced data.

### 6. K-means Clustering with PCA Data

- **Cluster Cryptocurrencies (PCA)**: The K-means algorithm is applied again using the PCA-reduced data to group the cryptocurrencies.
- **Visualization**: The clusters are visualized in 2D using the first two principal components (`PC1`, `PC2`) as axes. The hover functionality displays the `coin_id` for each point.

### 7. Comparison and Analysis

- **Elbow Curve Comparison**: We compared the elbow curves of the original scaled data with the PCA-transformed data to analyze the impact of dimensionality reduction on clustering.
- **Cluster Comparison**: We created composite plots to compare the clusters generated by the original scaled data versus the PCA-reduced data.
- **Conclusion**: We assessed the impact of using fewer features on clustering accuracy and visual clarity. The clustering results were **similar**, indicating that PCA effectively reduced the data dimensionality without significant loss of information.

## Results

### Best _k_ Value

- The optimal number of clusters (_k_) for the original data is **4**.
- After applying PCA, the optimal _k_ value was **4**. The results showed **similarity** in clustering behavior.

### PCA Explained Variance

- The total explained variance from the 3 principal components is **89.5%**, indicating that the majority of the original information is retained.

### Analysis of Feature Reduction

- The PCA-reduced data allowed for simplified clustering while retaining most of the relevant information, which led to **minimal** differences in the clustering results.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how unsupervised learning techniques, such as K-means clustering, and dimensionality reduction methods, such as PCA, can be effectively applied to cryptocurrency data to uncover underlying patterns and groupings. By comparing clustering results before and after dimensionality reduction, we found that PCA did not significantly impact the clustering performance, indicating that the reduced features still captured the essential information needed for effective clustering. This suggests that feature reduction through PCA can simplify the data without compromising the quality of the clustering results.
